*2.	Extracts mean and standard deviation from training and test datasets.
*3.	Loads activity and subject data from each dataset and merges with the dataset.
*4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This is shown in the output file called cleandata.txt.
